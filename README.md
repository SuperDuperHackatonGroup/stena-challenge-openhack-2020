## Problem/Challenge
In the world, we actually use and consume natural resources 1.75 times faster than our planet can regenerate and restore them. In Sweden, it’s much worse. We consume natural resources FOUR times faster than ecosystems can regenerate them, according to the Global Footprint Network.
The challenge is mainly concerned with the shift from linear production cycles where products are produced, used, and then disposed of, to a more circular production cycle where products are produced of reused products, which are then reused and recycled into even newer products. 

## Solution
In a world of increasing accountability and awareness of the perils of climate change, consumers are demanding more transparency from manufacturers. There is an increasing pressure for corporations to be more open with emissions they produce, so Reclaim has come up with a solution to foster transparency between both parties. Our software generates unique QR codes for every item purchased, stating the carbon footprint of all resources utilized from production of the good all the way to delivery of the item to the customer; further, the QR code contains points for every effort made to reduce greenhouse emissions.

We will license our software to corporations, wherein they can fill out the necessary data required to generate the QR code. Consumers have the option to download our app on their phones, where a QR scanner will be available to them. The QR code will have data on carbon footprints their recent purchase(s) have produced, as well as incentives to remain accountable and have them keep using the app. For every QR code scanned, customers accrue points that may eventually lead to redeemable rewards. This leads to a more informed consumer who can make better decisions with their purchasing power, thus promoting further transparency globally.
 

## Idea behind the code
Reclaim is an app designed to encourage consumers to make purchases with the environment in mind. As mentioned in [Solution](#solution) we designed this app to help consumers, environment and the economy. By encouraging consumers to make environmentally friendly purchases, we get a step closer to achieving and sustaining a circular economy. 
 
A circular economy has a direct impact on our environment, and it plays one of the most important roles in reducing our carbon footprints. We should abandon the traditional linear value chain and reduce our waste as soon as possible. The impact of this effort might not be seen in the short run, but its positive effects on our environment will certainly be seen in the long run. 
 
Once again, we as a group designed this app to focus more on the consumers but our thought process is not limited to this. Consumers, producer, economy and environment are all directly connected to each other. Solving a problem that consumers face will have a positive outcome on the other aspects too.
